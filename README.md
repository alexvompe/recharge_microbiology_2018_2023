16S rRNA gene amplicon analyses for the Recharge project in Moorea, French Polynesia between 2018 and 2023.

This repository contains drafts of scripts and data files for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of coral microbiome data from the Recharge project between 2018 and 2023. The project, led by PIs Deron Burkepile, Rebecca Vega Thurber, and Thomas Adam, investigates the interactive effects of nutrient enrichment, consumer pressure, and environmental disturbances, such as marine heatwaves, on coral, algal, and fish communities. The analysis within this repository assess the microbiome as a potential mediator of these experimental and environmental disturbances in coral success.
