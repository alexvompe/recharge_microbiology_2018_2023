# recharge_microbiology_2018_2023
16S rRNA gene amplicon, fish biomass, and coral success analyses for the Recharge project in Moorea, French Polynesia between 2018 and 2023.

This repository contains scripts and data files for the 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of coral microbiome data and community ecology data from the Recharge project between 2018 and 2023. The project, led by PIs Deron Burkepile, Rebecca Vega Thurber, and Thomas Adam, investigates the interactive effects of nutrient enrichment, consumer pressure, and environmental disturbances, such as marine heatwaves, on coral, algal, and fish communities. The analyses within this repository assess the microbiome as a potential mediator of these experimental and environmental disturbances in coral success. All raw sequence data for the analyses are available here on the NCBI SRA: PRJNA994532 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA994532. Upon publication, the manuscript will be linked to this repository for analysis methodologies.
